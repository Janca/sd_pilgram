# SD_PILGRAM
*a fking A1111 SD extension*

SD_PIGLRAM will apply Instagram like filters to your image generations in the StableDiffusion WebUI written by Automatic1111.

This extension is currently in its infancy, but will be fleshed out with time. Currently allows you to select `1` or `All` filters to apply to your generated image. Requirements ([pilgram](https://pypi.org/project/pilgram/)) should be automatically installed when the extension loads.
